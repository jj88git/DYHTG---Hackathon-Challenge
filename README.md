Strategic Blackjack Game

Overview
- The Strategic Blackjack game is a web application designed to help users master the fundamental decision-making process in Blackjack: Hit or Stand.
- The core feature is the Strategy Helper display, which provides real-time advice based on the player's current hand total and the dealer's visible upcard.

How to Run:
- Install the live server extension and run the server locally. No additional extension or installation is required

Strategy Helper Logic

- The advice provided is based on a simplified version of standard casino Basic Strategy, assuming the following rules:
- Dealer Action: Dealer stands on all totals of 17 or greater.
- Player Hand: Advice is determined based on the combination of the Player's Hard/Soft total and the Dealer's upcard value.
- Recommendation: The Helper recommends "Stand" when the player has the mathematical edge, and "Hit" otherwise.
- JavaScript: Core game logic, state management, and DOM manipulation.
- Tailwind CSS: Used CSS for clean, modern, and responsive styling.
